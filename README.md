Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Process for Extended Iris Dataset

1️⃣ Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods.
For the Extended Iris Dataset, EDA helps us understand the patterns, relationships, and distributions within the data before applying any machine learning model.

2️⃣ Dataset Overview
Name: Extended Iris Dataset

Description: Contains measurements of iris flowers along with extended attributes such as soil type, sunlight exposure, and watering frequency.

Target Variable: Iris Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

Total Features: Core + Extended attributes

3️⃣ Steps in EDA Process

📌 Step 1: Data Loading & Inspection
Load dataset using Pandas.

Check first few rows with df.head().

Inspect data types, shape, and missing values.

python
Copy
Edit
df.info()
df.describe()
df.isnull().sum()

📌 Step 2: Statistical Summary
Use .describe() to get numerical feature statistics.

Identify mean, median, standard deviation, and ranges for each feature.

📌 Step 3: Data Cleaning
Handle missing values (if any) via imputation or removal.

Convert categorical columns to numerical (Label Encoding).

Remove duplicates if present.

📌 Step 4: Univariate Analysis
Histograms → Distribution of individual features.

Boxplots → Detect outliers and spread of data.

Countplots → Frequency of categorical variables.

📌 Step 5: Bivariate Analysis
Scatter Plots → Relationships between two numerical features.

Pairplots → Compare multiple features at once.

Correlation Heatmap → Identify linear relationships.

📌 Step 6: Multivariate Analysis
Pairplot by Species → Visualize how features separate species.

3D Scatter Plots → Explore feature interactions.

Group Statistics → Compare feature means across species.

📌 Step 7: Extended Features Visualization
Bar charts for soil type vs average petal/sepal sizes.

Stacked plots for sunlight exposure and species distribution.

Boxplots to compare watering frequency across species.
