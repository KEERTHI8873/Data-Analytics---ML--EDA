Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Iris Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of visually and statistically summarizing data to understand its structure, spot patterns, detect anomalies, and generate insights before applying machine learning models.

For the Iris dataset, the EDA process involves:

1. Understanding the Dataset
Objective: Identify the type of data, features, and target variable.

Actions:

Load the dataset using pandas.read_csv() or from sklearn.datasets.

Display the first few rows using df.head() to get an initial feel.

Check the dataset shape (df.shape) to know the number of rows and columns.

Review column names and their meanings (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width, Species).

2. Data Summary & Structure
Objective: Understand the data distribution and basic statistics.

Actions:

Use df.info() to check data types and missing values.

Use df.describe() for summary statistics (mean, std, min, max, quartiles).

Check class balance with df['species'].value_counts().

3. Univariate Analysis
Objective: Study each variable independently.

Actions:

Histograms for each numeric feature to see distribution.

Boxplots to detect outliers.

Count plots for the target variable (Species).

4. Bivariate Analysis
Objective: Explore relationships between features and the target.

Actions:

Pair plots (sns.pairplot) to visualize feature relationships across species.

Scatter plots for selected feature pairs, colored by species.

Violin plots to compare feature distributions per species.

5. Correlation Analysis
Objective: Identify relationships between numerical features.

Actions:

Calculate correlation matrix using df.corr().

Visualize with a heatmap (sns.heatmap) to spot strong or weak correlations.

6. Insights & Observations
Typical findings for the Iris dataset:

Petal length and petal width are highly correlated and useful for classification.

Sepal measurements show more overlap between species.

Setosa is well-separated from other species in feature space.

Versicolor and Virginica overlap slightly, making classification more challenging.

7. Visualization Tools Used
Matplotlib for basic charts.

Seaborn for advanced visualizations (pair plots, violin plots, heatmaps).
